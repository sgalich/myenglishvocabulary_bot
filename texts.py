	start="""I have 3 baskets of words you\'ve ever sent me.

1. UNKNOWN words. As you send me any word I place it in this basket.
Then you can list these words using your keyboard. When you feel you became familiar with a particular word, just tap 👍 to move it in the next basket.

2. FAMILIAR words. This basket should contain words you know their meaning, but you are not confident using them. Just list these words some time. When you feel you know this word tap 👍 to place it in the next basket.

3. KNOWN words. Here will be words you\'ve learned.

Use 👎 to move a word from KNOWN to FAMILIAR or from FAMILIAR to UNKNOWN.
Use 🚫 to delete a word.

Good luck!""",
